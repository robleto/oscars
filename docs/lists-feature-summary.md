## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to `/lists` to view all your lists
2. Click "Create New List" to add a new list
3. Click on any list card to view/edit the list
4. Use the "Add Movies" button to search and add movies
5. Use the "Edit" button to enable drag-and-drop reordering
6. Click movie ratings to edit scores
7. Use the eye icon to toggle seen/unseen status
8. Toggle between grid and list views using the view buttons

### For Developers
1. All list-related routes are under `/lists`
2. Components are organized in `src/components/list/`
3. Types are defined in `src/types/supabase.ts`
4. Database setup SQL is in `docs/database-setup.md`
5. Follow the existing patterns for authentication and data fetching

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Efficient JOIN queries for movie details
- Batch operations for ranking updates
- Optimistic UI updates to reduce perceived latency

### Client-Side Optimization
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Local state management for immediate feedback
- Lazy loading of movie images
- Efficient re-rendering with React keys

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own private lists
- Public lists are readable by everyone
- Only list owners can modify their lists
- Proper user authentication checks

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation for form inputs
- Server-side validation through Supabase
- Protection against SQL injection
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Collaborative Features
